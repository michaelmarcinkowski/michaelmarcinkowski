<p>I guess that this is starting as a test of the effectiveness of writing directly. Of trying to find a middle way for compositon today to be apart from aparatuses of influence. I want the text to be its own thing. I want the publsihing of the text to be its own thing.</p>

<p>The bigest question facing writing today is the matter of distribution. This is meant to be an antidote to the problem in that it gets rid of the idea of distribution in general.</p>
